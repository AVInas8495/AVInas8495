                    UP Legislature’s foundation traces its way back to the flame the revolt of 1857 ignited against
                    British
                    rule, originating in modern-day Uttar Pradesh. This revolt swept away the very essence of the

                    message – India could not and would not be taken lightly.

            The Revolt of 1857 is widely known in India as its First War of Independence. It was not the first time
            Indian natives rose up against the British, nor was it the last. However, it was the rapidity of this
            particular incident that set it apart and led to the subsequent events in our history’s chronicles. 
            The rebellion was not a black and white sequence of events, but was very complex. The rebellion

            mutiny of the sipahis in Meerut on 10th May 1857. There was general unrest as the last independent
            region
            of India - Awadh - had finally been annexed by the Company. With this already budding resentment, a
            rumour
            that the new cartridges being provided to the Indian soldiers had Cow and Pig fat. The cartridges had to
            be opened with one’s mouth. This rumour caused outrage in both the Hindu and Muslim communities as Cows
            are sacred to Hindus and Muslims consider Pigs as unclean.

            the
            news in the neighbouring areas. Even though this rebellion was limited to the northern region with
            modern
            day Uttar Pradesh at its heart, the siege extended its blood well into the next year. The Lucknow
            Residency had two relief attempts by the British before they could rescue their survivors. Kanpur and
            neighbouring areas were similarly entrenched in the developments of the ongoing rebellion. 
            Historians say the savagery with which the Company retaliated had never been seen before, especially in
            India. The blood shed, lives lost and the atrocities the year of the rebellion saw were manganimously
            high. The news reached Britain, albeit with altered narratives, and shocked many a people.
