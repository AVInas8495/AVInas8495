              Most of the meetings of this Council were held in the Government House

                  Adult Franchise under the new constitution of India was formed in 1952, four years after the Indian

                  British
                  rule, originating in modern-day Uttar Pradesh. This revolt swept away the very essence of the East

              The Revolt of 1857 is widely known in India as its First War of Independence. It was not the first time
              Indian natives rose up against the British, nor was it the last. However, it was the rapidity of this
              particular incident that set it apart and led to the subsequent events in our history’s chronicles. 
              The rebellion was not a black and white sequence of events, but was very complex. The rebellion

              of India - Awadh - had finally been annexed by the Company. With this already budding resentment, a rumour
              that the new cartridges being provided to the Indian soldiers had Cow and Pig fat. The cartridges had to
              be opened with one’s mouth. This rumour caused outrage in both the Hindu and Muslim communities as Cows
              are sacred to Hindus and Muslims consider Pigs as unclean.

              news in the neighbouring areas. Even though this rebellion was limited to the northern region with modern
              day Uttar Pradesh at its heart, the siege extended its blood well into the next year. The Lucknow
              Residency had two relief attempts by the British before they could rescue their survivors. Kanpur and
              neighbouring areas were similarly entrenched in the developments of the ongoing rebellion. 
              Historians say the savagery with which the Company retaliated had never been seen before, especially in

              high. The news reached Britain, albeit with altered narratives, and shocked many a people.

                It was after this rebellion that the British Crown assumed direct control over the British held Indian

                sovereign power over India, ending the era of India being ruled by a trading organisation.

                  Constitutional History of India, serving to mark the beginning of the representative institutions in
                  India. No attempt had so far been made to associate Indians with the administration of their own
                  country. In 1861, however, with the passage of the Indian Councils Act, Indians would now be a part of
                  their legislative institutions. </span>

                <span class="d-block mb-3">The eighties of the 20th Century saw the Birth of the Indian National
                  Congress. It took up the
                  question of Legislative reforms. The Councils and the Indian representation within them had proved to
                  be inadequate, disappointing, and merely tokenistic. </span>
                <span>As a result of the Indians’ unabating demands, the Indian Councils Act, of 1892 was passed. While
                  it
                  did not provide for the principle of election, it was laid down that the members of the provincial
                  legislative council were to be nominated by the Governors, not without the recommendations of the
                  District Boards, Municipalities, Landlords, and Merchants. The member count was raised to fifteen. The
                  Council members now also had the right to ask questions under the provisions of the act. When this
                  Council met for the first time on December 6th, 1893, Raja Ram Pal rose to ask the first question in
                  the history of the Council after the Lt. Governor made his opening speech. </span>

                  to the British administration, and the humiliation of Indians in South Africa – the Indians did not
                  hold back in expressing their disquiet.</span>

                  the Indian Councils Act of 1909. The Act instituted changes in some of the functions and rights of the
                  council, the number of members that would form the council, and the provisions for
                  electorates. </span>
