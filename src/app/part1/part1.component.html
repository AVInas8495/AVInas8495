                    Ancient India was no stranger to Democracy. The concept of
                    democracy was not only common but prevalent in large sections
                    of society, for example in local governments, trade unions,
                    religious assemblies, etc. Elaborate procedures for elections
                    existed as far ago as the Vedic times. <br />The parliamentary
                    form of governance we see today in India as well as the west
                    has been prevalent in the Indian subcontinent long before the
                    British arrived. Mentions of Sabhas and Samitis can be traced
                    back to Vedic Literature as well as the likes of Dharma Sabhas
                    of the Buddhists within India. Up until the 16th century, this
                    kind of governance expanded to different parts of the
                    subcontinent before the land was subjected to different
                    invasions.

                These sabhas and samitis were a forum to have open debates, where everyone was free to speak their mind
                on the matters being debated. Deliberations of every kind with regard to policy, governance, or public
                redressal among many others were
                done within these Sabhas.

                The final resolution was only passed when all the members were in agreement over the resolution. The

                satisfied with their local redressal systems, which would then be discussed in the Sabha and addressed.

                These institutions were very prevalent all over the subcontinent
                before it gradually started disappearing when different invaders
                established their own rule and in effect their own styles of
                governance on the land they were on. In the Mahabharat period,
                the form of governance came very close to that what we have in
                the present day. These governments slowly evolved into
                monarchical styles of governance with invasions.  They almost
                completely dissipated when Mughals entered the Subcontinent.

                British presence in the Awadh region came later than in most parts of India. While there were certain
                pockets that were governed by the Company byelaws, for example the Company factory in Agra as well as
                the region that fell within its compound in 1619 in Agra, that was the extent of their engagement in
                administration till 1773. <br><br>
                In 1773, the then Mughal Emperor legally transferred the regions of Ghazipur and Banaras that were under
                his jurisdiction to the Company. The Company then gradually started to widen its reach within the UP
                region. All the territories that subsequently came under the company had as their legislature the
                Governor General’s Council in Calcutta who could issue rules and ordinances as long as they were in line
                with the UK law. Over time they made Agra their headquarters for their North Western Indian territories.
