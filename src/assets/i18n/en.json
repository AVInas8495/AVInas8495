    "P1": "The soil of Uttar Pradesh is seeped in rich ancient history that has been witness to our democratic traditions long before the subcontinent claimed Independence from the British.",
    "P2":"Ancient India was no stranger to Democracy. The concept of democracy was not only common but prevalent in large sections of society, for example in local governments, trade unions, religious assemblies, etc. Elaborate procedures for electionsb existed as far ago as the Vedic times. The parliamentary form of governance we see today in India as well as the west has been prevalent in the Indian subcontinent long before the British arrived. Mentions of Sabhas and Samitis can be traced back to Vedic Literature as well as the likes of Dharma Sabhas of the Buddhists within India. Up until the 16th century, this kind of governance expanded to different parts of the subcontinent before the land was subjected to different invasions.",
    "DIV1":"Over the years, when these Sabhas did lose their agency when compared to the position they held before, they were still equipped to dismiss a king if the members decided a King’s actions were against the law of the land and/or against public interest. ",
    "SPAN1":"The Sabhas mentioned in the Vedas as well as Mahabharat were essentially the means to deliberate on the various policies of the state as well as public welfare. They had a Sabhapati who was elected by this very Sabha and would be a part of all the proceedings of the sabha.",
    "IMG1":" These sabhas and samitis were a forum to have open debates, where everyone was free to speak their mind on the matters being debated. Deliberations of every kind with regard to policy, governance, or public redressal among many others were done within these Sabhas.",
    "IMG2":" Their function was to assist the Sabhapati run the state smoothly.The final resolution was only passed when all the members were in agreement over the resolution. The public was free to seek redressal and come to the sabha with their grievances should they not be satisfied with their local redressal systems, which would then be discussed in the Sabha and addressed. ",
    "DIV2":"These institutions were very prevalent all over the subcontinent before it gradually started disappearing when different invaders established their own rule and in effect their own styles of governance on the land they were on. In the Mahabharat period, the form of governance came very close to that what we have in the present day. These governments slowly evolved into monarchical styles of governance with invasions.  They almost completely dissipated when Mughals entered the Subcontinent.",
    "P3":"An understanding of the gradual progression from the downfall of the Mughal Empire to the British East India Company taking the reigns of the Awadh region culminating in the set up of a Legislature for British-held India.",

    "DIV3":"These sabhapatis were also referred to as Kings, but it is key to note that they were elected by the sabha, essentially making the government a republic. Ancient India was predominantly a collection of republics, not monarchies. ",
    "SPAN3":"Over the years, when these Sabhas did lose their agency when compared to the position they held before, they were still equipped to dismiss a king if the members decided a King’s actions were against the law of the land and/or against public interest.",
    "DIV4":"British presence in the Awadh region came later than in most parts of India. While there were certain pockets that were governed by the Company byelaws, for example the Company factory in Agra as well as the region that fell within its compound in 1619 in Agra, that was the extent of their engagement in administration till 1773. <br><br> In 1773, the then Mughal Emperor legally transferred the regions of Ghazipur and Banaras that were under his jurisdiction to the Company. The Company then gradually started to widen its reach within the UP region. All the territories that subsequently came under the company had as their legislature the Governor General’s Council in Calcutta who could issue rules and ordinances as long as they were in line with the UK law. Over time they made Agra their headquarters for their North Western Indian territories.",
    "DIV5":"In 1856, Awadh was the last state that the Company had no direct control over. As they grew impatient, they annexed the state under the Doctrine of Lapse stating the then Nawab - Nawab Wajid Ali Shah was an unfit King.  Awadh hence came under the Company’s control in 1856, the company now having annexed the last Independent Indian territory.",
    "DIV6":"The first step in the development of our legislature in what we now know as Uttar Pradesh came in the year 1853. It came with a Charter from the British Crown that extended the East India Company’s trade in the Indian territories indefinitely and created virtually a separate Legislative Council for the British Territories in India with the Governor General at its head.",

   "UP":"  UP Legislature’s foundation traces its way back to the flame the revolt of 1857 ignited against British rule, originating in modern-day Uttar Pradesh. This revolt swept away the very essence of the East India Company, transferring the administrative power of the subcontinent to the British Crown. The story of our representation within our legislature starts from this very revolt, the revolt that sent a clear message – India could not and would not be taken lightly.",
   "REVOLT":"The Revolt of 1857 is widely known in India as its First War of Independence. It was not the first time Indian natives rose up against the British, nor was it the last. However, it was the rapidity of this particular incident that set it apart and led to the subsequent events in our history’s chronicles. The rebellion was not a black and white sequence of events, but was very complex. The rebellion essentially began as a",
   "REVOLT2":"mutiny of the sipahis in Meerut on 10th May 1857. There was general unrest as the last independent region of India - Awadh - had finally been annexed by the Company. With this already budding resentment, a rumour that the new cartridges being provided to the Indian soldiers had Cow and Pig fat. The cartridges had to be opened with one’s mouth. This rumour caused outrage in both the Hindu and Muslim communities as Cows are sacred to Hindus and Muslims consider Pigs as unclean. ",
   "NEWS":"News of the Meerut mutiny spread like wild fire. Individual mutiny’s erupted with the reception of thenews in the neighbouring areas. Even though this rebellion was limited to the northern region with modern day Uttar Pradesh at its heart, the siege extended its blood well into the next year. The Lucknow Residency had two relief attempts by the British before they could rescue their survivors. Kanpur and neighbouring areas were similarly entrenched in the developments of the ongoing rebellion. Historians say the savagery with which the Company retaliated had never been seen before, especially in India. The blood shed, lives lost and the atrocities the year of the rebellion saw were manganimously high. The news reached Britain, albeit with altered narratives, and shocked many a people.",

The news reached Britain, albeit with altered narratives, and shocked many a people.  <br> It was after this rebellion that the British Crown assumed direct control over the British held Indian territories, on the 1st of November 1858. With this move, The East India Company ceased to be a sovereign power over India, ending the era of India being ruled by a trading organisation.",

   "ASSUM":"The assumption of administrative power by the British Crown in 1858 ushered in a new era in the Constitutional History of India, serving to mark the beginning of the representative institutions in India. No attempt had so far been made to associate Indians with the administration of their own country. In 1861, however, with the passage of the Indian Councils Act, Indians would now be a part of their legislative institutions. ",
   "AFTER":"After the Indian Councils Act was passed in the year 1861, the council for the North Western Provinces and Awadh at the time could not be formed even after 25 long years. It was in January of 1887 that the first council was formed in the state. Out of a total of nine members, four Indian members were to be included in this council for the first time.",

   "EIGHT":"The eighties of the 20th Century saw the Birth of the Indian National Congress. It took up the question of Legislative reforms. The Councils and the Indian representation within them had proved to be inadequate, disappointing, and merely tokenistic. ",
   "ASRESULT":"As a result of the Indians’ unabating demands, the Indian Councils Act, of 1892 was passed. While it did not provide for the principle of election, it was laid down that the members of the provincial legislative council were to be nominated by the Governors, not without the recommendations of the District Boards, Municipalities, Landlords, and Merchants The member count was raised to fifteen. The Council members now also had the right to ask questions under the provisions of the act. When this Council met for the first time on December 6th, 1893, Raja Ram Pal rose to ask the first question in history of the Council after the Lt. Governor made his opening speech. ",
   "CLEAR":"It was clear that the Act of 1892 was a mere appeasement strategy by the British as it did not institute any real changes. With the growing dissatisfaction in this time period – given Lord Curzon’s despotic and oppressive policies nationwide calamities like the famine and plague owing to the British administration, and the humiliation of Indians in South Africa – the Indians did not old back in expressing their disquiet.",

   "1916":"In 1916, the Congress and the Muslim League united and ceaselessly demanded for Home-Rule. The World War had just entered a critical stage at the time.
